# tidy_project

The tidy_project repo contains R scripts and files for the Getting and cleansing data Project.
the purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
The initial data  is related to an experiment that has been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the experimeters captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

It was asked to :
 
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
*1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repo contains 
*1) An R script called run_analysis.R that contains one script for performing the needed analysis where each step is commented to gives detailed explanation.
*2) A code book called CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data in order to obtain the tiddy data. 
*3) A README.md that explains how the script work and what the different files did.
